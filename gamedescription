::What is the Relay Game

Relay is a game where people are put in an order and a "torch" is passed through the line. The torch is a message written in some language, and all grammar and vocabulary needed for understanding that message, but no translation or even gloss of the message.

Passing the torch means figuring out what the meaning of the message is, translating it into your own language, documenting only the relevant vocabulary and grammar, and sending it to the next person.

Thus the game of Relay is similar to the game of Telephone. Changes in the message are inevitable, and in fact, the whole point of the game.

:::House Rules

,Once your turn is over (or if you skip it), update the relay chat topic, or witness first-hand someone else updating it. If you decide to skip your turn, you send the stuff forwards. Don't expect the stuff to travel automatically.

The following house rules exist to protect the relay site host's eyes from getting spoiled.

,Once your turn is over, if $host's turn is not yet over, keep your stuff in a safe place because you will have to send it to $host eventually.
,As soon as your turn and $host's are both over, send your torch and an English translation of your version of the text to $host. The text itself and the translation are the only actually critical ones, the rest not so much.
